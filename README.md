Mobile Application Development
Programming Assignment #1
Tip Calculator
Due: Tuesday, February 10th
For this assignment, you are to create a simple tip calculator application.
There are lots of these applications available, but you will design one that makes sense to you.

When you eat at a restaurant, it is customary to tip the server.
The general rule of thumb is 15% to 20%. But in different situations, it can vary.
At a buffet or bar it may be 10-­‐15%, or when you have a large party, it should be closer to 20%.
If you have exceptional service (either bad or good), you want to adjust it.
If your kids have made a terrible mess, it is always a good idea to add some extra.
Most people like to round up or down to a nearest dollar.
Maybe you are with a group of friends and you want to tip and split the tab.

Decide what works for you and build an app.

Here are therequirements.
  • The interface is key—it must be simple to use and clean (not too cluttered).
  • The input needs should be kept to a minimum and selecting the right widgets (views) is important.
  • Be sure the tip amount and the total is clear. If you are filling out a credit card slip you want to know both of those values.
  • You must effectively use two widgets beyond what you used in Lab 1 (TextView, EditText and Button).
  • Design an icon for your App
  • Add your own twist or spin. 
  
The app will be judged by the functionality (does it work), the user interface, icon design, and your creativity.

In order to help the grader (and me) please use P1<webid> as the Application name and <webid>.olemiss.edu for company domain.
So my Application name would be P1dwilkins and I would use dwilkins.olemiss.edu as the company domain (package name edu.olemiss.edwilkins.p1dwilkins).

Submit yoursolution to Blackboard as Prog1.
